# ready-to-build-dj-app
ready-to-build-dj-site is an edited version of the [Django Web framework](https://github.com/django/django). I created it so I would have a default folder structure 
to start with for future projects. The following is what I added:

- static package that contains an images folder and styles.css file
- templates package that contains a base.html file and other.html file
- an empty docs directory
- an empty LICENSE.txt file
- an empty README.txt file
- a template MANIFEST.in file
- a template setup.cfg file
- a template setup.py file
